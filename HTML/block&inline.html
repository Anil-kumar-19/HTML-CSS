     <p style="border: 2px red solid;">To understand the difference between the two isomers of limonene, introduction to some 
new terms and concepts are required. The most important being the concept of chirality. 
A chiral object is one that cannot be superposed on its mirror image. The term originates 
from the greek term for “hand”. As it is with human hands, the left hand cannot be 
superimposed on the right hand. It is the same with chiral molecules. They are non
superimposable mirror images of each other. Achiral objects, on the other hand, are easily 
superimposable on each other. A tennis racquet and a spoon are examples of achiral 
objects.

<p style="border: 2px yellow solid;">The next question that comes to the mind is how to determine whether a molecule is 
chiral or achiral. At times, it becomes extremely difficult to determine with increasing 
molecular complexity, to determine the non superimposibity of a compound with its 
mirror image. Thus,  a mathemathical concept known as group theory can be applied to 
determine the symmetry elements in a molecule. There are four symmetry elements 
which needs to be considered for this purpose: </p>
